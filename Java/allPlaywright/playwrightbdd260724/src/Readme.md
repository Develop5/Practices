The junit-bom is JUnit's Bill Of Materials (BOM). When including this BOM, it will ensure to align and manage all JUnit 5 dependency versions for you. 

Referencing a bom file under <dependencyManagement><dependencies> only manages versions to be compatible. You still need to declare all needed dependencies under <dependencies> but without <version>. Thats how Maven bom references work. IntelliJ can handle them that way too.

You can find more information about the BOM concept as part of:
