* [List interface link](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html)

* Elements from array are accessed by using the index in [], but from ArrayList we must use getters

* **List.of** creates a list by using a variable argument list of elements

* Array elements can be accessed directly with **[]**. Size of array is taken by using **length**

* ArrayList elements can only be accessed by using **getters** and **setters**. Length by **size()**

* Array is fixed in length. ArrayLists size is variable

* ArrayLists come with built-in support. Arrays don't.
  * See .toString() and .deepToString()

* ArrayList **don't support primitive** types

* Both can be created from a list of elements or from an array of elements. Both are static methods on factory types.

* Arrays.asList returns a special instance of a list that is not resizable, but is mutable.
