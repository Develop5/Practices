### Polymorphism in action ###

It's the ability to execute different behavior, for different types, which are determined at runtime.

Polymorphism enables you to write generic code, based on the base class, or a parent class.

This code, in the main method, is extendable, meaning it doesn't have to change, as new subclasses become available.

This code can handle any instances that are a Movie, or a subclass of movie, that are returned from the factory method even though it does not exist yeat.
