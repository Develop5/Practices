### Guidelines

## This file is only to declare issues and show how they are being solved
At the end of the day, it is likely this file wll disappear.

### Issues:
1. Need to build properly from Chapter01
2. Is the build folder in Chapter01 properly created? It looks like it needs a manifesto.
3. There are warnings and issues during the build. I have ignored all them by now, but maybe they are related to #2
