### POJO ###

## Plain Old Java Object ##

= Bean
= JavaBean

A class that generally only has instance fields

It is used to house data and pass data between functional classes.

It usually has few, if any methods other than getters and setters.

Many databases use POJO's to read data from, or to write data to, databases, files or streams.

### Examples of POJOs ###

* A JavaBean is just a POJO, with some extra rules applied to it.
* A POJO is sometimes called an Entity, because it mirrors database entities.
* Another acronym is DTO, for Data Transfer Object.
* It's a description of an object, that can be modeled as just data.

### Support for POJO creation ###

There are many generation tools that turn a data model into generated POJO's or JavaBeans.
Example: Intellij generates **getters, setters** and **constructors** in an uniform way.

### Annotation concepts ###

Annotations are a type of metadata
Metadata is a way of formally describing additional information about your code.
This is because they can be used by the compiler, or other types of pre-processing functions, to get information about the code.
Metadata does not affect how the code runs, so the code will still run with or without the annotation.
