**Abstract Class extends another abstract class**

- It can implement all of the parent's abstract methods
- It can implement only some of them
- Or it can implement none of them
- It can also include additional abstract methods, which will force subclasses 
to implement both Animal's abstract methods as well as Mammal's (in our example)
