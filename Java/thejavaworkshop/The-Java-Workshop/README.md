# The-Java-Workshop

## My notes:

### Book reference:
C:\Users\lourd\Documents\FromLenovo\DescargasAEstudiar_Nuevo\Java\
The Java Workshop - A practical, no-nonsense guide to Java (2020).pdf

### Code reference:
https://github.com/TrainingByPackt/The-Java-Workshop


Note: **there are no** .iml files in the original code

### Original project cloned to:
/c/Users/lourd/Documents/Lenovo_D/Lourdes/practicando/Practices/Java/thejavaworkshop/The-Java-Workshop

## Resources

### Steps followed to install the base code
1) The project was cloned from the original inside a folder of my own.
2) Then, it was needed to delete the /.git folder
3) With this, the project was settled inside my original repository

Every time we switch module, the folder needs to be marked as the only source in the project structure.

That way, the Main file is found and becomes executable.

The folder "production" must be also excluded in the project structure.


### Executing from command line
1) javac Main.java
2) java Main

### Contrast final with immutable. 
An immutable object does not allow the data inside the
object to change. A final object does not allow the object to point to another object.

### Constructors
Are used to initializing the basic properties of classes, and so are used when assigning values to
variables, for instance.


### Access modifiers

There are four types of Java access modifiers:

**Private**: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.

**Default**: The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.

**Protected**: The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.

**Public**: The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package and outside the package.
