## Resources

### Steps followed to install the base code
1) The project was cloned from the original inside a folder of my own.
2) Then, it was needed to delete the /.git folder
3) With this, the project was settled inside my original repository

Every time we switch module, the folder needs to be marked as the only source in the project structure.

That way, the Main file is found and becomes executable.

The folder "production" must be also excluded in the project structure.


### Executing from command line
1) javac Main.java
2) java Main
