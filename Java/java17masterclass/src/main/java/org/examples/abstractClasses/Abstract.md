**Abstract classes**
An abstract class in your hierarchy forces designers to think about, 
and create unique and targeted implementations, for the abstract method.

An abstract class cannot be instantiated, 
so it is an advantage to use them to design a framework for implementation.

**Abstract Class extends another abstract class**

- It can implement all of the parent's abstract methods
- It can implement only some of them
- Or it can implement none of them
- It can also include additional abstract methods, which will force subclasses 
to implement both Animal's abstract methods as well as Mammal's (in our example)
