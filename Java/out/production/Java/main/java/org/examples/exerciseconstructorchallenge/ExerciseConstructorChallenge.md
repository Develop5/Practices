### Constructor Challenge exercise ###

1. Create a class calle Customer, with 3 fields:
   * name
   * credit limit
   * email address

2. Create the getter methods only, for each field. You don't need to create the setters.

4. Create 3 constructors for this class:
   * First, create a constructor for all three fields which should assign the arguments directly to the instance fields.
   * Second, create a no args constructor that calls another constructor, passing some literal values for each argument.
   * And lastly, create a constructor with just th name and email parameters, which also calls another constructor
