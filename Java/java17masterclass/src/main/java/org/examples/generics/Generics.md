### Generic type parameters ###

The most common idenfiers are:

* E for Element (used extensively by the Java Collection Framework)
* K for Key (used for mapped types)
* N for Number
* T for Type
* V for Value
* S, U, V for 2nd, 3rd and 4th types


### Raw usage ###

You can use generic classes without specifying a type parameter. 
This is call the **Raw Use** of the reference type.

The raw use of these classes is still available, for backwards compatibility,
but it's discouraged for several reasons.
