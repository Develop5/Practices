### Main difference between String and StringBuilder ###

**String** methods create a new object in memory, and return a reference to this new object.

**StringBuilder** methods return a StringBuilder reference, but it's really a self-reference.

A StringBuilder class has many similar methods to Strings.
But it also has methods to remove and insert characters or Strings, and truncate it's size.
