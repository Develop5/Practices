### Differences between "super" and "this" keywords ###


###
**super**
```
Used to access or call the parent class members (variables and methods)
```

**this**
```
* Used to call the current class members (variables and methods)
* **this** is required when we have a parameter with the same name, as an instance variable or field.
```

##
**NOTE**: We can use either of them anywhere in a class, except for static elements, like static method.
Any attempt to do so there, will lead to compile time errors.
