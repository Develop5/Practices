### Constructor chaining ###

Constructor chaining is when one constructor explicitly calls another overloaded constructor.

You can call a constructor only from another constructor.

You must use the special statement this() to execute another constructor, passing it arguments if required.

And this() must be the first executable statement, if it's used from another constructor.
